# Foodex
An Android app that shows you meal recipes that you can make with the selected ingredients.

## Functionality
The user will be able to select the ingredients he or she has in the kitchen. Then the app will sort ask the selected API for the recipes that only require those ingredients. The user will also be able to select an option to get recipes with a selected number of ingredients that the user does not have. 

## Motivation behind the idea
As a student, I have a fridge filled with food ingredients but dont know too much different ways to use them making meals. This application would help me with not having the same meals over and over again:)

## Requirements

1. As a user, I want to view all recipes, such that I look through them all.
2. As a user, I want to be able to select the ingredients I have, such that I could search for recepies with them.
3. As a user, I want to be able to search for recipes that require only the selected ingredients, such that I could make a meal with what I have.
4. As a user, I want to be able to search for recipes with a selected number or ingredients that I do not have, such that I could see more possibilities with my ingredients.
5. As a user, I want to be able to register in the system, such that I could login.
6. As a user, I want to be able to login in the system, such that I could save recipes.
7. As a user, I want to be able to save my recipes, such that I could access them later easily.
8. As a user, I want to be able to share a recipe, such that I could show others.
9. As a user, I want to see all the information about the recipe, such that I would know how to make it myself.
