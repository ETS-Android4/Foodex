# Foodex
An Android app that shows you meal recipes that you can make with the selected ingredients.

## Functionality
A food recipe app, where the user will be able to find lots of recipes with instructions. They will also be able to sort the recipes, save them for later, add the ingredients to their shopping list. They will also be able to add ingredients in to their pantry section and search for recipes that only require those ingredients.

## Motivation behind the idea
As a student, I have a fridge filled with food ingredients but dont know too much different ways to use them making meals. This application would help me with not having the same meals over and over again:)
