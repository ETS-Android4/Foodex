# Foodex
An Android app that shows you meal recipes that you can make with the selected ingredients.

## Functionality
The user will be able to select the ingredients he or she has in the kitchen. Then the app will sort ask the selected API for the recipes that only require those ingredients. The user will also be able to select an option to get recipes with a selected number of ingredients that the user does not have. 

## Motivation behind the idea
